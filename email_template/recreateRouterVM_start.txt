Dear FIRSTNAME LASTNAME,
<P>
We are about to migrate/recreate the virtual router VM that belongs to your domain <b>'ROUTERDOMAIN'</b> (ROUTERNAME).
<P>
During this your VMs will not have network connectivity. To trigger creation of a new router, we will deploy a new VM in your network, and then delete it again.
<P>
You will receive another e-mail when maintenance is finished.
<P>
Please contact us in case of any problems.
<P>
Kind Regards,
<BR>
<BR>ORGANIZATION
