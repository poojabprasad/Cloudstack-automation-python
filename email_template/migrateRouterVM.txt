Dear FIRSTNAME LASTNAME,
<P>
We will now migrate the virtual router VM that belongs to your domain <b>'ROUTERDOMAIN'</b> (ROUTERNAME).
<P>
If your router is a redundant pair, you will not experience any down time. If not, your VMs will have no
network connectivity during maintenance. Expected downtime is ~5 minutes.
<P>
Please contact us in case of any problems.
<P>
Kind Regards,
<BR>
<BR>ORGANIZATION
