Dear FIRSTNAME LASTNAME,
<P>
We have succesfully destroyed your router, but because there were no VMs running we did not create a new one.
<P>
A new router will be created automatically the next time you start a VM in your domain <b>'ROUTERDOMAIN'</b>. 
<P>
Please contact us in case of any problems.
<P>
Kind Regards,
<BR>
<BR>ORGANIZATION
