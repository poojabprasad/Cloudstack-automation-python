Dear FIRSTNAME LASTNAME,
<P>
We completed migrating the VM <b>'VMNAME'</b> that belongs to your domain <b>'DOMAIN'</b> to cluster <b>'TOCLUSTER'</b>.
<BR>The instance id of this VM is <b>'INSTANCENAME'</b> and before maintenance the state was <b>'STATE'</b>.
<P>
Note: your VM has NOT been started because it was not running before maintenance.
<P>
Do <b>NOT</b> start it via the CloudStack GUI or else it will be migrated back to the old storage and start on the last hypervisor it was running on.
<P>
Start the VM using <b>CloudMonkey</b>:
<P>
CLOUDMONKEYCMD
<P>
If you're unsure how to proceed, please contact us and we'll start the VM for you.
<P>
Kind Regards,
<BR>
<BR>ORGANIZATION
