Setup Marvin
===
To talk to the CloudStack API, these scripts use `Marvin` that comes with `Apache CloudStack`. Unfortunately, Marvin has changed quite a few times. Without backwards compatibility that is. Therefore, use the one in this repository and you're fine. Support for the latest version is being worked on, but that takes some time. 

Install the `tar.gz` using `pip`

  `pip install -Iv marvin/Marvin-0.1.0.tar.gz`
